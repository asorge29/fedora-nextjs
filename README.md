# Fedora Clone Showcase  

Welcome to the **Fedora Clone**, a web-based replica of the vanilla Fedora desktop environment with GNOME. This project showcases my frontend development skills and attention to detail in recreating Fedora's design.

## Why This Exists  

Initially created as my portfolio site, this project transitioned into a showcase of my frontend skills. Although it is responsive, navigating it on mobile was challenging due to its desktop-inspired layout. I also found it wasn't intuitive for users unfamiliar with Fedora. Instead of scrapping the design, I repurposed it into a frontend development showcase. Now, it lives as a technical demonstration of my ability to craft complex UIs.

## Keeping It Current  

As Fedora continues to evolve, I will update this clone to align with new Fedora releases when I have time to do so.
